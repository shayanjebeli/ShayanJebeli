### Hi there 👋

I'm **Shayan Jebeli**, a business development manager at Avax Plus with a diverse background in commerce, design, and technology.

I recently started learning Python to combine my business and creative skills with programming. I'm also experienced in **HTML**, **CSS**, **Photoshop**, and **marketing**, and I’m exploring the world of **data analysis** and **machine learning**.

Beyond tech, I have a strong interest in **cooking**, **international trade**, and **fashion branding** — I previously owned a clothing brand and still enjoy exploring new ideas across industries.

This GitHub space is where I document my learning journey, practice coding, and build simple projects as I grow.
